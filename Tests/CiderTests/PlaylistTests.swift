After first scoring with the Jackson 5, he embarked on his solo career in the early '70s. He teamed with producer Quincy Jones on two beyond-massive hits—1979's disco-meets-funk smash Off the Wall and 1982's genre-busting Thriller—and became The King of Pop. Four more chart-topping albums followed before his tragic death in 2009, but thanks to a catalog packed with classics, Jackson's music continues to thrill fans around the world.")
